<p>I wrote this program to help the FRC shirt trading community by making a spreadsheet that is a combination of membersâ€™ spreadsheets. If you are not familiar with FRC or shirt trading you probably did not understand a word of that sentence so ill give you some explanation.</p>

<h2 id="frc">FRC</h2>

<p>First Robotics Competition is a high school competitive robotics league. It has around +3500 teams across +25 countries. Teams will design, build, wire, and program a robot to compete in 3v3 matches against an opposing team. The way you score points each year is different so here is an example of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgniEjI9cCM">2022 game</a>.</p>

<h2 id="shirt-trading">Shirt Trading</h2>

<p>FRC is modeled like conventional sports, teams have mascots and team shirts. FRC does differ from conventional sports because it promotes cooperation and gracious professionalism at competitions which results in collaboration between teams. One example of this collaboration is shirt trading. Teams will make extra shirts to trade with at competitions or online. Shirts have different values depending on the team/s that are on them and how cool they are.</p>
